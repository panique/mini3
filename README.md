![MINI3 - A naked barebone PHP application](_install/mini3.png)

# MINI3

MINI3 is an extremely simple and easy to understand skeleton PHP application, reduced to the max.
MINI3 is NOT a professional framework and it does not come with all the stuff real frameworks have.
If you just want to show some pages, do a few database calls and a little-bit of AJAX here and there, without
reading in massive documentations of highly complex professional frameworks, then MINI3 might be very useful for you.
MINI3 is easy to install, runs nearly everywhere and doesn't make things more complicated than necessary.

[MINI](https://github.com/panique/mini) (original version) and [MINI2](https://github.com/panique/mini2) (used Slim router) were built by me (panique), MINI3 is an excellent and improved version
of the original MINI, made by [JaoNoctus](https://github.com/JaoNoctus). Big thanks, man! :)

## Features

- extremely simple, easy to understand
- simple but clean structure
- makes "beautiful" clean URLs
- demo CRUD actions: Create, Read, Update and Delete database entries easily
- demo AJAX call
- tries to follow PSR coding guidelines
- uses PDO for any database requests, comes with an additional PDO debug tool to emulate your SQL statements
- commented code
- uses only native PHP code, so people don't have to learn a framework
- uses PSR-4 autoloader

## Requirements

- PHP 5.6 or PHP 7.x (PHP 8.0 should also work fine)
- MySQL
- mod_rewrite activated (see below for tutorials)
- basic knowledge of Composer for sure

## Installation (in Vagrant, 100% automatic)

If you are using Vagrant for your development, then you can install MINI3 with one click (or one command on the
command line) [[Vagrant doc](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/provisioning.html)]. MINI3 comes with a demo
Vagrant-file (defines your Vagrant box) and a demo bootstrap.sh which automatically installs Apache, PHP, MySQL,
PHPMyAdmin, git and Composer, sets a chosen password in MySQL and PHPMyadmin and even inside the application code,
downloads the Composer-dependencies, activates mod_rewrite and edits the Apache settings, downloads the code from GitHub
and runs the demo SQL statements (for demo data). This is 100% automatic, you'll end up after +/- 5 minutes with a fully
running installation of MINI3 inside an Ubuntu 20.04 Vagrant box on PHP 7.4.x.

To do so, put `Vagrantfile` and `bootstrap.sh` from `_vagrant` inside a folder (and nothing else).
Do `vagrant box add ubuntu/focal64` to add Ubuntu 20.04 64bit to Vagrant (unless you already have
it), then do `vagrant up` to run the box. When installation is finished you can directly use the fully installed demo
app on `192.168.33.66`. As this just a quick demo environment the MySQL root password and the PHPMyAdmin root password
are set to `12345678`, the project is installed in `/var/www/html/myproject`. You can change this for sure inside
`bootstrap.sh`.

## Auto-Installation on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (in 30 seconds)

You can install MINI3 including Apache, MySQL, PHP and PHPMyAdmin, mod_rewrite, Composer, all necessary settings and
even the passwords inside the configs file by simply downloading one file and executing it, the entire installation
will run 100% automatically. If you are stuck somehow, also have a look into this tutorial for the original MINI1,
it's basically the same installation process:
[Install MINI in 30 seconds inside Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/install-mini-30-seconds-inside-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)

## Manual Installation

1. Edit the database credentials in `application/config/config.php`
2. Execute the .sql statements in the `_install/`-folder (with PHPMyAdmin for example).
3. Make sure you have mod_rewrite activated on your server / in your environment. Some guidelines:
   [Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-14-04-lts/),
   [Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/enable-mod_rewrite-ubuntu-12-04-lts/),
   [EasyPHP on Windows](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8158770/easyphp-and-htaccess),
   [AMPPS on Windows/Mac OS](http://www.softaculous.com/board/index.php?tid=3634&title=AMPPS_rewrite_enable/disable_option%3F_please%3F),
   [XAMPP for Windows](http://www.leonardaustin.com/blog/technical/enable-mod_rewrite-in-xampp/),
   [MAMP on Mac OS](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7670561/how-to-get-htaccess-to-work-on-mamp)
4. Install composer and run `composer install` in the project's folder to create the PSR-4 autoloading stuff from Composer automatically.
   If you have no idea what this means: Remember the "good" old times when we were using "include file.php" all over our projects to include and use something ?
   PSR-0/4 is the modern, clean and automatic version of that. Please have a google research if that's important for you.  
   
Feel free to commit your guideline for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS or other linuxes to the list!  

MINI3 runs without any further configuration. You can also put it inside a sub-folder, it will work without any
further configuration.
Maybe useful: A simple tutorial on [How to install LAMPP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP, PHPMyAdmin) on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/installsetup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-14-04-lts/)
and [the same for Ubuntu 12.04 LTS](http://www.dev-metal.com/setup-basic-lamp-stack-linux-apache-mysql-php-ubuntu-12-04/).

## Server configs for

### nginx

```nginx
server {
    server_name default_server _;   # Listen to any servername
    listen      [::]:80;
    listen      80;

    root /var/www/html/myproject/public;

    location / {
        index index.php;
        try_files /$uri /$uri/ /index.php?url=$uri&$args;
    }

    location ~ \.(php)$ {
        fastcgi_pass   unix:/var/run/php5-fpm.sock;
        fastcgi_index  index.php;
        fastcgi_param  SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
        include fastcgi_params;
    }
}
```

A deeper discussion on nginx setups can be found [here](https://github.com/panique/mini/issues/55).

## Security

The script makes use of mod_rewrite and blocks all access to everything outside the /public folder.
Your .git folder/files, operating system temp files, the application-folder and everything else is not accessible
(when set up correctly). For database requests PDO is used, so no need to think about SQL injection (unless you
are using extremely outdated MySQL versions).

## How to include stuff / use PSR-4

As this project uses proper PSR-4 namespaces, make sure you load/use your stuff correctly:
Instead of including classes with old-school code like `include xxx.php`, simply do something like `use Mini\Model\Song;` on top of your file (modern IDEs even do that automatically).
This would automatically include the file *Song.php* from the folder *Mini/Model* (it's case-sensitive!).
 
But wait, there's no `Mini/Model/Song.php` in the project, but a `application/Model/Song.php`, right ?
To keep things cleaner, the composer.json sets a *namespace* (see code below), which is basically a name or an alias, for a certain folder / area of your application,
in this case the folder `application` is now reachable via `Mini` when including stuff.

```
{
    "psr-4":
    {
        "Mini\\" : "application/"
    }
}
```

This might look stupid at first, but comes in handy later. To sum it up:

To load the file `application/Model/Song.php`, write a `use Mini\Model\Song;` on top of your controller file.
Have a look into the SongController to get an idea how everything works!

FYI: As decribed in the install tutorial, you'll need do perform a "composer install" when setting up your application for the first time, which will
create a set of files (= the autoloader) inside /vendor folder. This is the normal way Composer handle this stuff. If you delete your vendor folder 
the autoloading will not work anymore. If you change something in the composer.json, always make sure to run composer install/update again!

## Goodies

MINI3 comes with a little customized [PDO debugger tool](https://github.com/panique/pdo-debug) (find the code in
application/libs/helper.php), trying to emulate your PDO-SQL statements. It's extremely easy to use:

```php
$sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song WHERE id = :song_id LIMIT 1";
$query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
$parameters = array(':song_id' => $song_id);

echo Helper::debugPDO($sql, $parameters);

$query->execute($parameters);
```

## Quick-Start

#### The structure in general

The application's URL-path translates directly to the controllers (=files) and their methods inside
application/controllers.

`example.com/home/exampleOne` will do what the *exampleOne()* method in application/Controller/HomeController.php says.

`example.com/home` will do what the *index()* method in application/Controller/HomeController.php says.

`example.com` will do what the *index()* method in application/Controller/HomeController.php says (default fallback).

`example.com/songs` will do what the *index()* method in application/Controller/SongsController.php says.

`example.com/songs/editsong/17` will do what the *editsong()* method in application/Controller/SongsController.php says and
will pass `17` as a parameter to it.

Self-explaining, right ?

#### Showing a view

Let's look at the exampleOne()-method in the home-controller (application/Controller/HomeController.php): This simply shows
the header, footer and the example_one.php page (in views/home/). By intention as simple and native as possible.

```php
public function exampleOne()
{
    // load view
    view('views/_templates/header');
    view('views/home/example_one');
    view('views/_templates/footer');
}
```  

#### Working with data

Let's look into the index()-method in the songs-controller (application/Controller/SongsController.php): Similar to exampleOne,
but here we also request data. Again, everything is extremely reduced and simple: $Song->getAllSongs() simply
calls the getAllSongs()-method in application/Model/Song.php (when $Song = new Song()).

```php
namespace Mini\Controller

use Mini\Model\Song;

class SongsController
{
    public function index()
    {
        // Instance new Model (Song)
        $Song = new Song();
        // getting all songs and amount of songs
        $songs = $Song->getAllSongs();
        $amount_of_songs = $Song->getAmountOfSongs();

        // load view. within the view files we can echo out $songs and $amount_of_songs easily
        view('views/_templates/header');
        view('views/songs/index');
        view('views/_templates/footer');
    }
}
```

For extreme simplicity, data-handling methods are in application/model/ClassName.php. Have a look how getAllSongs() in model.php looks like: Pure and
super-simple PDO.

```php
namespace Mini\Model

use Mini\Core\Model;

class Song extends Model
{
    public function getAllSongs()
    {
        $sql = "SELECT id, artist, track, link FROM song";
        $query = $this->db->prepare($sql);
        $query->execute();

        return $query->fetchAll();
    }
}
```

The result, here $songs, can then easily be used directly
inside the view files (in this case application/views/songs/index.php, in a simplified example):

```php
<tbody>
<?php foreach ($songs as $song) { ?>
    <tr>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->artist)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->artist, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
        <td><?php if (isset($song->track)) echo htmlspecialchars($song->track, ENT_QUOTES, 'UTF-8'); ?></td>
    </tr>
<?php } ?>
</tbody>
```
